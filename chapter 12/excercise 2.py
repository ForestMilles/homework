#a How many functions are in the math module?

"""44"""

# b What does math.ceil do? What about math.floor? (hint: both floor and ceil expect floating point arguments.)
"""math.ceil(x)
Returns the ceiling of x which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. However, x does not have to be  a 
float and will go to x.ceil() to return an integral value.

math.floor(x)
Return the floor of x which is the largest integer less than or equal to x. If x is not a float it will also go to 
x.floor(), which should return an integral value."""

#c Describe how we have been computing the same value as math.sqrt without using the math module.
"""we made functions to find the aquare root using the ** symbol"""

#d What are the two data constants in the math module?
"""math.pi and  math.e"""
