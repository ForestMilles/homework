#5 Add the following statement to mymodule1.py, mymodule2.py, and namespace_test.py from the previous exercise:

#Run namespace_test.py. What happens? Why? Now add the following to the bottom of mymodule1.py:

#if __name__ == "__main__":
    #print("This won't run if I'm  imported.")


"""when i run namespace.py it says My name is _main_. it says this because i am printing it."""

#Run mymodule1.py and namespace_test.py again. In which case do you see the new print statement?

"""when i run moduel 1"""
